    "Advantages:-------\n",
    "Increased performance: Multithreading can lead to significant performance improvements for programs that \n",
    "perform many independent tasks, as it allows different parts of the program to execute simultaneously on \n",
    "different CPU cores.\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading can make programs more responsive, as it allows them to continue executing \n",
    "while waiting for I/O or other blocking operations to complete.\n",
    "Resource sharing: Multithreading allows multiple threads to access shared resources, such as files or \n",
    "databases, without requiring complex coordination mechanisms.\n",
    "Modular design: Multithreading can make programs easier to design and implement by allowing different\n",
    "parts of the program to be executed in separate threads, making the program more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "Disadvantages:--------\n",
    "Synchronization issues: Multithreading requires careful management of shared resources to avoid race\n",
    "conditions and other synchronization issues that can lead to errors or incorrect behavior.\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading can make programs more complex and harder to debug, as it introduces new\n",
    "sources of bugs and errors related to thread synchronization and communication.\n",
    "Overhead: Creating and managing threads requires additional resources, such as memory and CPU time,\n",
    "which can reduce the overall performance of the program if not managed carefully.\n",
    "Scalability issues: The benefits of multithreading may not scale linearly with the number of CPU cores\n",
    "available, as adding more threads may lead to diminishing returns or even reduce performance in some cases."
