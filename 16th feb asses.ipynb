    "NoSQL Databases: NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that do not use the \n",
    "traditional table-based schema. NoSQL databases are schema-less, meaning that data can be added to the \n",
    "database without defining the structure beforehand. Instead, NoSQL databases use various data models, \n",
    "such as key-value, document, graph, or column-family. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis."
