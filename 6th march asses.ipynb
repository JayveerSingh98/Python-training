    "variability, and shape. Descriptive statistics is generally used when data is available for the entire population of interest, or when\n",

    "-----Example of descriptive statistics: A researcher collects data on the heights of 100 students in a school. The researcher uses descriptive \n",

    "is generally used when data is not available for the entire population, and a sample is used to make inferences about the population.\n",
